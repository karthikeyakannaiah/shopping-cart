# Shopping Cart project
[Link](https://shopping-cart-by-karthikeya.netlify.app/)
My every project is a learning project, I always try to attempt something new. even if it's in small scale. I never worked with Redux. So I thought of simple shopping cart management using Redux. I used redux toolkit for this project and along with this, Tailwind CSS was used to help me out to save out my time and trauma of designing the page. With Tailwind CSS, I was able to create a simple Responsive layout.  

TO set up project on your workstation,
